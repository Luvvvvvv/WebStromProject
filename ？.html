                    development of the open source ecosystem. We believe that using the best tools can help make your
                    work more enjoyable and productive. So if you&#8217;re a project lead of a NumFOCUS-sponsored

                <p>At JetBrains, we believe that programming should not be just a job, but a pleasure, a hobby, and a
                    creative outlet. That’s why with this release our team has rebuilt the JetBrains Toolbox extension
                    from the ground up. Now you can easily open your Git repositories in your favorite IDE and navigate
                    from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket files, or selected lines of code to the JetBrains IDE that fits best.
                    This nice new integration will save you valuable time.</p>
                <h2>GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket Integration</h2>
                <p>Download the <a
                        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jetbrains-toolbox-extensi/offnedcbhjldheanlbojaefbfbllddna">Chrome</a>
                    and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jetbrains-toolbox/">Firefox</a>
                    extensions, and you’ll see just how simple and useful they are. Previously, these extensions were
                    only able to clone and open your Git repositories in your favorite tool. Now they allow you to also
                    open the selected file in your IDE. And what’s more – available from 2019.3 EAP versions of all IDEs
                    – you can navigate to the line of code you have selected from the Git repository service to your IDE
                    with just one click!<br/>
                    <span id="more-9800"></span></p>
                <p>We’ll demonstrate briefly how the JetBrains extension functions work in the screenshots below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clone and open your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repositories in the IDE right from your
                        browser. In the Git project, just click on the icon of the IDE which is the best fit for the
                        project, and open the project there with ease.
                    </li>

                <h2>Updated Toolbox App UI</h2>
                <p>We have updated the UI for Toolbox App 1.16. Each tool now has its own update progress bar under each
                    tool.<br/>
                    We have also summarized the progress for all tool updates in the general progress bar, which can be
                    found under the small arrow in the Toolbox App header. Click on it to see the progress of all the
                    tool updates.</p>

                <h2 id="insert_shortcuts">Insert Shortcut Action in Task Descriptions</h2>
                <p>We believe teaching people how to use development tools is an important part of teaching programming
                    languages and technologies. We also believe mastering shortcuts is one of the most productive skills
                    a future developer can have. To help your learners build their confidence with this smoothly, you
                    can now easily insert an IDE shortcut into a task description:</p>

                    inside your IDE – giving you even less reason to switch back and forward from the Stepik website to
                    your IDE! It may be convenient to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/viewing-modes.html">adjust

                <p>Making mistakes is an important – even necessary – part of any learning process. We encourage you to
                    try out your solutions and submit your attempts. Now you can also take a look at your task
                    submissions, so you can reflect on them and go back to your previous attempts and try to rerun or
                    improve on them:</p>

                <p>Syntax errors are so common even for professional developers. But syntax errors are not such a big
                    problem with an IDE at your back to help catch and fix them. With more clear and detailed output,
                    PyCharm Edu now helps you catch syntax errors while learning as well:</p>

                <h2>For Educators</h2>
                <h3>Improved support for YAML configs</h3>
                <p>With EduTools plugin version 2.7, we completely reworked our solution for storing course
                    configuration files: all the information about your course is conveniently stored in YAML format.
                    Now, we’ve made some more improvements to give you a better experience when using this
                    functionality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Non-existent elements (such as files and lessons) are highlighted as errors and can be created
                        right from their usages.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                </a></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigate to a selected element from its usage.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Completion shows available files, lessons, and so on in the corresponding places in config
                        files.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rename refactorings can be called up from YAML config files and the Project Tree.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>New course creator features</h3>
                <p>Now you can configure placeholder dependencies when the placeholder is created:</p>
                <p><a href="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-03_18-11-24.png"

                with Zina to find out more about her professional path.</em></p>

                <p><b>Can you tell us about your background and how you decided to become a developer?</b></p>
                <p>It didn&#8217;t happen overnight, but like all worthy things in life, it took a lot of time and
                    effort. It all began when I was on maternity leave as a junior researcher at the Institute of
                    Precambrian Geology and Geochronology of the Russian Academy of Sciences.<br/>
                    <span id="more-9683"></span></p>
                <p>Having a baby changes one&#8217;s life in a lot of ways. Personally for me, it became abundantly
                    clear that life is short and I should spend mine doing something that matters, in addition to
                    parenting of course. I have always wanted to code. In fact, I had been admitted to both the
                    Mathematics &amp; Mechanics and Chemistry departments, but had ended up choosing chemistry – I&#8217;m
                    still not sure why. Continuing in the chemistry track seemed to make sense, especially after 5 years
                    of undergrad study + a few years of postgrad on top of that. I told myself it was too late to switch
                    gears, the train had left the station, and so on.</p>
                <p>Then my maternity leave happened, and I found myself in a seemingly never-ending routine… It reminded
                    me of Groundhog Day in some ways. But, it made me realize I needed to keep my brain additionally
                    occupied. I thought, why not give programming a shot? I mean I was staying at home all day anyway. I
                    went on Stepik.org and took their Python courses. When I completed those, I knew I would become a
                    developer, no matter how long it might take me. It was my calling. Oh, and I wasn&#8217;t aware back
                    then that JetBrains had an EduTools plugin that integrates with Stepik and lets you complete courses
                    right in JetBrains IDEs — if I’d known that, I would have saved lots of time and effort.</p>
                <p><b>Interesting! What happened next?</b></p>
                <p>After the Python courses, it was a turning point for me because I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do next.
                    A friend then advised me to switch to Java.</p>
                <p>Half a year later, I found an internship at <a href="http://javaops.ru/">Top Java</a>, a
                    Russian-language training course for developers aspiring to code in Java. The course guides you
                    through building a fully functional Spring/JPA Enterprise application, complete with authentication
                    and access management, and based on the technology stack including Spring, Hibernate, PostgreSQL,
                    Bootstrap, JS, etc. From my first attempt at the course, I absorbed only about half – there was a
                    lot to learn, and the pace was quite fast. You had to read a lot, think, and figure things out on
                    your own. But in my opinion, that&#8217;s the great thing about it, because from day one, you get
                    used to finding information on your own and using Google as your best friend that knows everything.
                    My payment plan covered code review, and that was just awesome. I believe code review is the key to
                    growing as a developer. In my team today, 100% of code gets reviewed.</p>
                <p><b>Were those skills enough to let you pass developer job interviews?</b></p>
                <p>My final project as an intern helped me win another internship, which was also very interesting and
                    useful. After the second internship, I began preparing for interviews intensely and kept learning a
                    lot. I passed my first test interview via Skype and then started sending out CVs. To be honest,
                    interviews weren&#8217;t the biggest hurdle for me. I received an offer after my very first
                    interview, without even a test assignment. The next day, the Educational Products team at JetBrains
                    invited me for an interview, too.</p>
                <p><b>How did that interview go?</b></p>
                <p>I loved the initial interview: the questions were great, I could sense right away that everyone was
                    passionate about their work, and things looked friendly and fun. I went home excited, but not daring
                    to hope. Imagine my surprise when in a couple days I received a test assignment! By that point I had
                    already accepted the first offer I got, and it almost seemed wrong to backtrack on it – I had no
                    idea how the JetBrains thing would turn out. I managed to get a two-week extension for my start date
                    at the first place, and used that time to complete the test assignment for JetBrains. Then I began
                    working at the first place (I actually liked it there; it was about web, Spring, and Hibernate), and
                    spent a week there. During that time I passed the final interview at JetBrains and finally got the
                    job I have now.</p>
                <p><b>How do you feel about working as a developer on the Educational Products team?</b></p>
                <p>Right now I&#8217;m a junior developer with Educational Products and I&#8217;m happy. Not only am I
                    doing what I love, but my work is very meaningful. Our plugin, EduTools, helps people much like me:
                    those who are learning programming from scratch, turning their lives around by completing courses in
                    various programming languages in JetBrains IDEs, and eventually launching their career in software
                    development. My own experience shows that it&#8217;s never too late to pursue your dream job, even
                    if you&#8217;re a new mom on maternity leave.</p>
                <p><b>Thanks a lot for sharing your story, Zina! Good luck in your future endeavors!</b></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting up a user group is not easy. But doing stuff you enjoy with peers who
                share your passion, keeping your knowledge and skills sharp and up to date by learning new things, and
                meeting other people in your profession, makes it all totally worth it.</p>
                <p>At JetBrains, we are a team of determined developers and enthusiasts; code is our passion. Creating
                    great tools is not possible without inspiration, teamwork, feedback, and attention to detail.
                    Building a user group requires a lot of the same qualities.</p>
                <p>Among us, we have many keen and experienced user group organizers. In this article, we want to share
                    with you their tips and tricks for creating a successful user group.</p>
                <p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/qvJKBbh1WNo.jpg"

                        class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9613"/></p>
                <p><span id="more-9536"></span></p>
                <h3><strong>Find co-organizers</strong></h3>
                <p>Running a user group is usually much more work than you first expect. Finding co-organizers who share
                    your dreams and duties and can provide you with support and feedback, is key to getting your user
                    group off the ground. You’ll be spending a lot of time together – brainstorming, programming,
                    running events – so your team should be made up of people who you can get along with.</p>
                <p><em>“It can be a time sink, and you NEED other people to help. You might be sick or have a vacation
                    planned; someone needs to still run the group” (Rachel Appel, a former organizer of .NET
                    Valley)</em></p>
                <h3><strong>Look for sponsors</strong></h3>
                <p>Your user group could be independent or company-run. In any case, you’re going to need sponsors to
                    cover the expenses for things like the location, speakers, prizes, and everything else.</p>
                <p>For company-based user groups, it’s easier to find sponsorship, location, and promotion. You can send
                    invitations through the company’s mailing list to inform more potential attendees, invite speakers,
                    and advertise the meetup on the company website. It’s beneficial for a company to host the user
                    group meetups too, as it can help them support their brand in the local market.</p>
                <p><em>“One thing that worked out very well for us was to start searching for sponsors early on. It
                    gives a bit of a cushion to help out with organizing things; we have once used some sponsor money to
                    throw a BBQ at one of the meetups, … it helps us, and helps the sponsors with visibility, definitely
                    a good thing to do!” (Maarten Balliauw, Azure User Group Belgium)</em></p>
                <h3><strong>Choose a location</strong></h3>
                <p>Any place with a projector or a big screen that is easily accessible and quiet enough for
                    presentations to be heard would work. Free wi-fi would also be a bonus.</p>
                <p><em>“Cost is a huge factor. Another is access to the location. Finding places near metro stations or
                    where you don’t need to drive an hour out of town is key” (Rachel Appel, a former organizer of .NET
                    Valley)</em></p>
                <p>Still, the most popular solution is a company office or a dedicated event space. If a user group has
                    sponsors, they are likely to host the meetups at their place.</p>
                <p><em>“When we have a speaker, we reach out to one or two of the sponsors to see if they have a room
                    available in their company to host 30-40 people, and if they have: that’s our location” (Maarten
                    Balliauw, Azure User Group Belgium)</em></p>
                <p>Are you looking for a place that is a little less formal to host your event? Try your favorite pub or
                    coworking space. Organizing a summer party is an excellent opportunity to change up the format and
                    discuss topics in a more relaxed atmosphere.</p>
                <h3><strong>Invite speakers</strong></h3>
                <p>You can look for speakers in your local community, through professional connections, at conferences,
                    or at other user group meetups. If a potential speaker plans to visit your city – contact them in
                    advance and invite them to give a talk at your event.</p>
                <p><em>“You can always reach out to people you don’t know through social networks, and they are usually
                    very happy to come and speak at events – if their costs are covered” (Rachel Appel, a former
                    organizer of .NET Valley)</em></p>
                <p>Take note of all the people who have shown interest in or want to speak at your user group. Keep a
                    list of potential speakers and topics, and reach out to those people when organizing your next
                    event.</p>
                <p>A speaker doesn’t need to be well-known or have thousands of followers on Twitter. Right now there
                    could be someone in your user group who is involved in an exciting project, working on a
                    cutting-edge topic, or wishing to share their insight and experience on solving challenging
                    issues.</p>
                <p><em>“I encourage new people to try and make a talk for the first time. Every meetup I engage people
                    to contact me and share their ideas. Often it is these ideas that get made into a talk a few months
                    later. Every good speaker was a newbie at some point, and user groups can help you grow in that
                    direction. So my goal is not only to invite good speakers but to help people become one” (Anastasia
                    Kazakova, St.Petersburg C++ User Group)</em></p>
                <p>However, don’t get frustrated if you cannot find a speaker or if they cancel their talk at the last
                    minute:</p>
                <p><em>“Not every meetup needs a speaker. Hack sessions and discussion rounds can also be successful
                    formats” (Justin Kaeser, Munich Scala User Group)</em></p>
                <h3><strong>Stick to the plan</strong></h3>
                <p>When you have an organizational team and a potential location – book a date in your calendar and
                    don’t back out. This helps fight procrastination and the quest for perfection.</p>
                <p><em>“Find 1-2 other people to spread the workload – but also make sure your goals align. Find and
                    talk to other user group leaders – not necessarily in the same technology/field – and ask them for
                    help. Fight for regular events – it’s what keeps your group alive” (Yann Cebron, JUG Hannover)</em>
                </p>
                <p><em>“Just do it! I wanted to start a user group for a long time, but I didn’t feel I could do it.
                    Sometimes I struggle with fewer people willing to give a talk; sometimes I have to struggle with
                    other things. But I know and love the community, and I feel it is all worth it”. (Anastasia
                    Kazakova, St.Petersburg C++ User Group)</em></p>
                <h3><strong>Keep it regular</strong></h3>
                <p>Regular meetups work much better for promoting your user group and bring you more members. An event
                    doesn’t need to be ideal; even just a few people will give you some experience and inspiration for
                    the future.</p>
                <p><em>“I try to be ready with the next event announcement before the previous event so that I can
                    invite people in person to the next meetup. I usually include the announcement on the next meetup in
                    my intro presentation at the beginning of each event.” (Anastasia Kazakova, St.Petersburg C++ User
                    Group)</em></p>
                <p>It’s a good idea to have a fixed day for your meetups (e.g., the first Thursday of every month). If
                    there are established user groups in your area – make sure your events don’t run across. Social
                    media and word of mouth can help attract more people to your events.</p>
                <p><em>“Twitter and our newsletter are our main drivers. LinkedIn and Facebook come second.” (Maarten
                    Balliauw, Azure User Group Belgium)</em></p>
                <p>Use all the possible communication channels available to you. You cannot overpromote an event. Even
                    established user groups can have a poor turnout from time to time. Don’t be afraid – just keep
                    going.</p>
                <p><em>“I just announce out events on meetup.com and sometimes tweet from my own twitter account (which
                    is now about 1300 followers) and then get a list of RSVPs and a waiting list. However, our regular
                    drop-off rate is 40-50%. Which is totally fine.” (Anastasia Kazakova, St.Petersburg C++ User
                    Group)</em></p>
                <h3><strong>Talk to your attendees</strong></h3>
                <p>Involve the community: ask them to tell you what interests them and who they want to meet. Some user
                    groups prefer an interactive format for the initial meetup. They provide questions and let the
                    attendees discuss. This helps the organizers determine the interests and expectations of the user
                    group members. If you make a list – you are likely to get a schedule for your next events.</p>
                <p><em>“We used to have a Google Form to gather feedback after each event, but stopped doing that after
                    we realized not everyone was using it and it was not representative. Now we try to chat with people
                    to hear what they thought of the meetup/speaker” (Maarten Balliauw, Azure User Group Belgium)</em>
                </p>
                <p>If there are a lot of questions after a talk, you may want to suggest continuing in the nearest cafe
                    or pub.</p>

                <h3><strong>Get prizes for your user group members</strong></h3>
                <p>Stickers, notebooks, t-shirts, software licenses all make great giveaways and prizes for attendees.
                    They are not a necessity, but they are a nice bonus that can become a good tradition to support your

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Please give a warm welcome to Educational Products 2019.2! Enjoy upgraded IDEs
                for Education and the EduTools plugin v2.8, use the <code>unittest</code> framework for Python courses,
                and get ready to learn with our brand new courses.</p>

                <h2>IDEs for Education</h2>
                <p>Both of our IDEs that offer an immersive learning experience – PyCharm Edu and IntelliJ IDEA Edu
                    (Community Educational with the bundled EduTools plugin) – have been updated to v2019.2, combining
                    the best of major IDE releases with the latest EduTools plugin.</p>
                <p><span id="more-9575"></span></p>
                <p>In addition to all the fresh features we’ve just rolled out in PyCharm 2019.2 and IntelliJ IDEA
                    2019.2, the Educational versions of both IDEs come with the following improvements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>YAML</code> configuration files for managing course structure in educator mode. Read more
                        about <code>YAML</code> support <a
                                href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/meet-yaml-format.html">here</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Multiple-choice tasks for local courses (previously, only choice tasks from Stepik were
                        supported).
                    </li>
                    <li>While you create a new course, you don’t have to specify the author anymore. Add the author’s
                        name only when generating a local course archive.
                    </li>
                    <li>Checking in Gradle-based courses is now a lot faster.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Specifically, PyCharm Edu 2019.2 offers the following as well:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>unittest</code> is now the default framework for tests when creating Python courses (but
                        old tests are still supported for existing courses).
                    </li>
                    <li>Test results can be viewed in <em><strong>Test View</strong></em> in the Educator mode.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>EduTools 2.8</h2>
                <p>The latest EduTools plugin upgrade is here to give you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python: <code>unittest</code> is now the default framework for tests in Python courses (but old
                        tests are still supported for existing courses).
                    </li>
                    <li>Rust: Cargo workspaces are now used to load courses faster in the Learner mode.</li>
                    <li>Issues with <code>YAML</code> have been fixed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Check out the plugin <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools">release notes</a>
                    and upgrade now!</p>
                <h2>Unit tests for Python</h2>
                <p>We’ve replaced our custom Python tests with the <code>unittest</code> framework. Now course creators
                    can add verification tests using this test library:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Course creators can now use <code>unittest</code> – one of the most popular testing frameworks,
                        instead of getting used to our custom Python tests. This enables easy navigation between tests
                        and their output in the <em><strong>Run</strong></em> tool window and more convenient workflow
                        for developers already familiar with the library.
                    </li>
                    <li>Learners now can get an expected/actual results comparison in the <strong><em>Task
                        Description</em></strong> panel and check the <code>diff</code> right away with the <strong><em>Compare</em></strong>
                        outputs action to check what exactly went wrong.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9589"

                editing them, and helps you generate ignore rules using templates.</em></p>
                <p><strong>Welcome, Jakub! Before we get started, could you please tell us a bit about yourself and your
                    background?</strong></p>
                <p>I started my development journey in primary school with Pascal. I had strong support from my teacher
                    and his code listings from a dot-matrix printer. That was a very exciting beginning for a young
                    fellow and sometimes I miss it a bit. Over the next 18 years, I explored some other programming
                    languages like C, Perl, Java, PHP, and C# and ending, for now, with NodeJS, TypeScript, and Kotlin.
                    My focus has mainly been on the web development and DevOps with a touch of JetBrains plugins
                    crafting in my free time.</p>
                <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9552"
                        src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jb5.jpg"
                        alt="Jakub Chrzanowski" width="1000" height="706"/></p>
                <p><strong>What is the .ignore plugin and how did it come about?</strong></p>
                <p>The .ignore plugin is a tool that helps developers handle .gitignore files in a more complex format
                    than just a plain text file with some glob-like rules. The main features of the plugin are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Syntax highlighting,</li>
                    <li>Marking ignored files in the Project View,</li>
                    <li>Providing predefined templates from <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">https://github.com/github/gitignore</a>,
                    </li>
                    <li>Custom user templates.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span id="more-9539"></span></p>
                <p>In addition to the basic functionality that was provided at the very beginning of the project, many
                    smaller integrations with the IDE itself can be found. Support for subsequent file types is
                    constantly being added too, because it is not only .gitignore files that are supported. Files such
                    as .dockerignore, .npmignore, .prettierignore, and .hgignore (Mercurial version control system that
                    uses both glob and regex rules) are handled, plus many others whose support has been requested by
                    the users.</p>
                <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9543"
                        src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image4.png" alt="image4"
                        width="944" height="534"/></p>
                <p><strong>Why did you decide to create the plugin and what’s your motivation for its continued
                    development over the years?</strong></p>
                <p>Just over five years ago, at my previous company we were using Git and PhpStorm for some work around
                    the Symfony framework and WordPress add-ons. The project structure was a bit tricky and .gitignore
                    was used heavily, but unfortunately, there was no built-in support for the project files tree
                    coloring in the IDE. I had seen this kind of feature probably in Eclipse before and thought that it
                    would be pretty handy to have it here as well. After digging into the IntelliJ IDEA SDK and some
                    other open-source plugins on GitHub and a few days of work in the basement (literally), I had
                    finally managed to handle <a
                            href="https://github.com/JetBrains/idea-gitignore/commit/5b8dbab31af5b805fc402d7686a591215072844">very
                        basic syntax coloring</a>.</p>
                <p>After releasing this version, the first feature request appeared in the <a
                        href="https://github.com/JetBrains/idea-gitignore/issues/1">GitHub issues</a> in relation to
                    making some use of the community-driven gitignore templates repository hosted by GitHub itself.</p>
                <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9541"
                        src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image1.png" alt="image1"
                        width="873" height="625"/></p>
                <p>Over the next few years, lots of ideas appeared: some good ones, but also some not-so-good ones. The
                    SDK evolved and new IDEs were released (CLion, Rider), which caused me a little bit of trouble, and
                    as I am not a JetBrains developer, it could be tricky to work with some core functionalities in the
                    proper way. There was always something to do and because of the growing community, I felt obliged to
                    deliver something that would be helpful and free from bugs. The download statistics and community
                    support always gave me an additional boost so that it was (almost ;-)) always fun.</p>
                <p><strong>What is the current state of the plugin and what are the plans for its future development and
                    features?</strong></p>
                <p>Currently, the .ignore plugin is in a maintenance phase and supports the IDEs in versions from 2017.1
                    to 2019.1.3. The decision to limit the support for the 2019.2 was made together with JetBrains
                    because there is native support for .gitignore planned in the next IDE versions and this will avoid
                    some functionality conflicts.</p>
                <p>For now, the .ignore plugin repository has been <a
                        href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/07/support-for-vcs-ignores-in-intellij-idea-and-intellij-based-ides">transferred
                    to the JetBrains</a> organization account.</p>
                <p><strong>Have you developed any other plugins for IntelliJ-based IDEs?</strong></p>
                <p>Currently I am working on the extension for Search Everywhere called <a
                        href="https://github.com/hsz/intellij-packages-search">Packages Search</a>. It will let you
                    quickly search for the packages/dependencies across the NPM/Maven/Packagist/PyPi repositories and
                    present the results with the item details (plus maybe some quick install/update actions). A <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/hszanowski/status/1127864685259304962">proof of concept video</a>
                    was recently published on my Twitter as well as a <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/hszanowski/status/1151006002604650496">call for plugin testers</a>.
                </p>
                <p>A few years back I also started working on the LaTeX plugin which I have since put on hold because of
                    some time limitations and a lack of knowledge about the lexer. But no worries – it is going to be
                    rebooted, rewritten with Kotlin, and include all of the good practices I’ve learned since then.</p>
                <p>There were also some other small plugins that didn’t really get any attention and this is totally
                    fine, because not everything that we develop has to be a must-have-killer-feature. But we have to
                    keep trying. <img
                            src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png"
                            alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/></p>
                <p><strong>Can you tell us what you liked about the plugin development process and what could be
                    improved?</strong></p>
                <p>The process for the development of plugins has improved over recent years. It is now very easy to set
                    up a basic plugin scaffold using Gradle and the Kotlin language, which I’d personally recommend to
                    everyone. The deployment process is very simple thanks to the <a
                            href="https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin">gradle-intellij-plugin</a> and
                    allows you to create a nice CI/CD process.</p>
                <p>The only thing that can get a bit complicated is supporting multiple IDE versions (2016.x, … 2019.x)
                    because of the differences in the SDKs and the deprecations/new features. It requires some branching
                    model in the git repository – there is probably a better way to do it, but that was enough for me at
                    this point.</p>
                <p><strong>Do you have any recommendations or tips for anyone who wants to build on top of the IntelliJ
                    Platform?</strong></p>
                <p>Besides the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/welcome.html">official SDK
                    documentation</a>, which may be useful at the beginning, I can definitely recommend searching the
                    plugin repository, which allows you to filter the results for the referenced plugins’ source code.
                </p>
                <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9542"

                        width="1338" height="481"/></p>
                <p>Checking the sources of others can be a great inspiration and a real time saver.<br/>
                    Also, you have to remember about communication – ask other developers for help if you get stuck, ask
                    for a review, test, and try to publish your plugin to a wider audience. Building the community
                    around your open source project is just as important as the time you invest in your work.</p>
                <p><em>Thank you Jakub for taking the time to chat with us and for your work on the .ignore plugin for
                    the IntelliJ-based IDEs.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our newest plugin update to v2.7 comes with YAML support for course creators,
                multiple-choice task support, new courses, and 2019.1.2 IDE builds for PyCharm Edu and IntelliJ IDEA
                Edu.</p>
                <p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1500x800_new1.png"

                <h2>YAML support</h2>
                <p>Course creators, welcome a completely reworked solution for course configuration files storage!
                    Previously, all course metadata was stored in XML format. Now you can see all the information about
                    your course conveniently stored in YAML format. We worked hard to make this possible and we hope
                    that you will like the YAML support as much as we do.</p>
                <p><span id="more-9500"></span></p>
                <p>YAML has a number of advantages such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple and understandable structure of configuration files</li>
                    <li>Easy VCS storage with a more clear <strong>diff</strong></li>
                    <li>Highlighting for invalid values and suggestions of available variants for values in
                        completions
                    </li>
                    <li>Lightweight and readable document appearance achieved by the reduction of tags and delimiters
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/post27_yaml.png"

                <p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/meet-yaml-format.html">Read the documentation</a>
                    for more information about YAML and new configuration guides.</p>
                <p>You can also take a quick look at a YAML guide in the Course Creator mode &#8211; select <em>YAML
                    Help</em> tab next to the <em>Task Description</em> panel.</p>

                <h2>Multiple-choice tasks</h2>
                <p>We’ve added multiple-choice tasks support for courses created via the plugin (previously, only choice
                    tasks from Stepik courses were supported).</p>
                <p>To create a multiple-choice task:<br/>
                    &#8211; open the <em>task-info.yaml</em> file<br/>
                    &#8211; set <strong><em>type</em></strong> to <strong><em>choice</em> </strong><br/>
                    &#8211; set <strong><em>true</em></strong> or <strong><em>false</em></strong> for <strong><em>is_multiple_choice</em></strong>
                    field<br/>
                    &#8211; add properties for task options</p>

                    Algorithms</a>”. The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems
                    arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy
                    algorithms, and dynamic programming.</p>

                <p>Since the course was introduced, learners have been able to complete programming assignments in
                    various programming languages. Now, for those students who are submitting solutions in Python, the
                    course provides integration with the EduTools plugin and encourages learners to solve programming
                    challenges in PyCharm Edu before submitting the solution on the course page. As a professional IDE,
                    PyCharm Edu helps learners format and structure their code, as well as test and debug it.</p>
                <p>Go to <em>File | Start Coursera Assignment </em>and select <strong>Algorithmic Toolbox</strong>.
                    Solve programming assignments and submit them to Coursera.</p>

                <p>Note that the course is featured on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and is a paid
                    one. You can still solve tasks and run basic local test cases for free, but you need to join the
                    course on Coursera to submit, verify on a large number of test cases and get a certificate. At
                    Coursera, a trial period and financial aid are available.</p>

                    href="https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/">JetBrains Academy</a>, a new educational experience for
                future developers. JetBrains Academy enables learners to select projects to practice on and go through
                Java topics required for completing these projects, following their individual curriculum and tracking
                progress through the Knowledge map.</p>

                <p>The Hyperskill platform features the Knowledge Map, many available topics, and project selection,
                    while project completion is enabled via IntelliJ IDEA Edu (IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition with the
                    EduPlugin installed).</p>
                <p>We thank all of you who joined JetBrains Academy for being with us and sharing your feedback! Since
                    the release, we’ve taken in your suggestions and worked hard to improve your learning experience.
                    Here are some of our latest features and updates.</p>
                <h2>More Java and Computer Science Essentials</h2>
                <p><span id="more-9477"></span></p>
                <p>Since the release, we’ve added 15 new Java topics. Сheck <em><strong>Abstract factory</strong></em>
                    and <em><strong>Factory method</strong></em>, <em><strong>Binary Heap</strong></em>, <em><strong>Swing
                        components</strong></em>, <em><strong>JMenu</strong></em>, <em><strong>Standart logger</strong></em>,
                    and many more &#8211; and try new challenges.</p>
                <p>In addition to Java, now you can learn the foundations of Computer Science. Understand the
                    differences between the many search, sorting, and string algorithms, and which ones are best for
                    each practical application. Topics are already available at the Knowledge Map – select <em><strong>Essentials</strong>
                    </em>and dive straight in!</p>
                <p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-07-04_16-47-23.png"
                        alt="JBA_Essentials" width="2572" height="1538" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9481"/></p>
                <h2>Problem of the Day</h2>
                <p>Repeating what you’ve learned is important for building a strong foundation for your skills. To
                    encourage you to keep practicing, every 24 hours Hyperskill offers a new problem from among your
                    completed topics. Check the Curriculum to take on the challenge.</p>
                <p><img src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/JBA_blog_problem.png"

                </p>
                <h2>Put the test to the test</h2>
                <p>So, you submitted a task and it failed the verification test. This is a normal part of the learning
                    process! However, being stuck on the same assignment can be frustrating and might hinder your
                    progress.</p>
                <p>Now you can download the test that your solution fails and check what exactly went wrong. Once every
                    24 hours, one test for a random code challenge you’re facing becomes available to you. Discover what
                    you can improve and keep progressing!</p>
                <h2>New Knowledge Map view</h2>
                <p>Use the Knowledge Map to check all the available topics and how they relate to each other. In
                    addition to the original Table view of the graph, we’ve added a collapsible Tree view of the graph.
                    Optimize the interface and track your progress in the way that’s best for you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With more than 4,000 available plugins, the <a
                    href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com" target="_blank">Plugins Repository</a> is able to deliver a
                variety of third-party plugins that can extend your JetBrains product on demand. There are plugins to
                bring you everything from additional languages and new technology support to cloud integrations, to
                themes, learning shortcuts, and even a Nyan Cat progress bar. Plugins for pretty much all the JetBrains
                tools including, but not limited to, all the IntelliJ–based IDEs, TeamCity, and .NET tools.</p>
                <p>Today we want to introduce to you the brand-new <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/marketplace"
                                                                      target="_blank">JetBrains Marketplace</a>
                    platform, a new evolutionary step for the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com" target="_blank">Plugins
                        Repository</a>. This new platform provides an opportunity for third-party plugin developers to
                    sell and license their plugins using an out-of-the-box solution provided by JetBrains. With this
                    platform addition, more developers will be able to dedicate more of their “official working time” to
                    plugin development on a longer-term basis, as sometimes it can be challenging to invest and dedicate
                    so much of their time to when it doesn’t help towards paying the bills.</p>
                <p>Third-party plugin developers won’t need to invest their time into their own licensing solutions and
                    creating the sales workflows themselves anymore. What this means for you, as plugin users, is that
                    you can enjoy even more feature-full high-quality plugins to help you develop with pleasure.</p>
                <p><a href="https://jetbrains.com/store/plugins" target="_blank"><img

                        alt="blog_less_text" width="800" height="400"/></a></p>
                <p><span id="more-9463"></span>The currently available plugins are not going anywhere. It is just that
                    over the years, we’ve seen more and more companies and individual developers choose the IntelliJ
                    Platform and other JetBrains tools as the platform they prefer to build their own developer
                    productivity tools for, including commercial ones. With the JetBrains Marketplace, we’d like for
                    plugin developers to be able to focus on developing their plugins instead of using their time to
                    implement custom license management solutions and building distribution channels. As a part of the
                    marketplace solution, we are providing an out-of-the-box software licensing solution, billing and
                    sales infrastructure, and marketing and sales support.</p>
                <p>As a plugin user, you can take advantage of the following benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Additional functionality thanks to paid plugins from third-party developers.</li>
                    <li>Simple plugin installation, payment, sign-up, and management via <a
                            href="https://account.jetbrains.com" target="_blank">JetBrains Account</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Easy-to-use licenses using your <a href="https://account.jetbrains.com" target="_blank">JetBrains
                        Account</a>, including management of all subscriptions/licenses with the on-premises license
                        server.
                    </li>
                    <li>Co-terming of licenses with JetBrains product licenses (optional).</li>
                    <li>Various discounts (e.g. volume), special licenses (User Group, Opensource, etc.), and other
                        programs supported by JetBrains (available soon.)
                    </li>
                    <li>Security and privacy protection: no need to provide credit card information or any other data to
                        an external entity when purchasing a plugin.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Right now the new third-party plugins are only available for our IntelliJ-based IDEs, but we are
                    planning to extend the support to other tools too, so please stay tuned!</p>

                <p>We are happy to tell you that the Toolbox App is now being used by over 440,000 users. We appreciate
                    your loyalty and trust and would love to hear from you here in the comments or on Twitter mentioning
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/JBToolbox">@JBToolbox</a> on which features we need to include to make
                    your experience with the Toolbox App even better.</p>
                <p>Here is an overview of the latest improvements to the Toolbox App.</p>
                <h2>JetBrains Account integration</h2>
                <p>The Toolbox App now uses OAuth to authenticate you in the JetBrains Account. This has a lot of
                    benefits:</p>
                <p><strong>Single Sign-On:</strong> log in to your JetBrains Account once in your favorite browser and
                    then approve the Toolbox App to access this account. There is no longer any need to enter your
                    credentials again.</p>
                <p><strong>License information:</strong> the Toolbox App now lets you quickly buy a license if it can&#8217;t
                    find one for your account. Just click on the “Buy” button and go straight to the store page.</p>
                <p><strong>Improved Security:</strong> the Toolbox App only has access to a limited scope of account
                    data, and the access can be revoked at any time.</p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-18-at-12.26.47.png"
                       rel="attachment wp-att-9425"><img
                            src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screenshot-2019-06-18-at-12.26.47.png"
                            alt="Toolbox App Security" width="558" height="294"
                            class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9425"
                            style="border: 1px solid #dfdfdf; padding: 0px;"/></a></p>
                <h2>Plugins update automatically</h2>
                <p>With Toolbox App 1.15, plugins are now stored alongside the IDE and are updated automatically
                    together with the IDE, saving you time and removing the need for additional manual actions.<br/>
                    You may notice an additional <strong>&#8220;Updating plugins…&#8221;</strong> step during the
                    installation. Since every build now has a separate plugin directory, the update is possible even
                    when another build is running.</p>
                <p><a href="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/updating_plugins.png"

                        src="https://d3nmt5vlzunoa1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/updating_plugins.png"

                <p><span id="more-9410"></span></p>
                <h2>Improved performance</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>We&#8217;ve significantly increased the responsiveness of the application and improved the CPU
                        usage during updates, especially for situations where there are hundreds of projects in your
                        Projects tab. The focus handling on Windows is now much more reliable as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>Shell scripts are now generated more reliably.</li>
                    <li>The root cause for crashes on Windows has been found and fixed.</li>
                    <li>This is the last release that will support 32-bit Windows. As all our IDEs have moved to 64-bit
                        only, it doesn’t make much sense for us to ship 32-bit binaries. If you still use the Toolbox
                        App on x86 Windows, it will continue to work for the foreseeable future, but we urge you to
                        upgrade to get all the latest and greatest features from all our products.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Browser Extension: GitLab and BitBucket integration</h2>
                <p>And there&#8217;s more great news! Thanks to our awesome contributors <a
                        href="https://github.com/Johannestegner">@Johannestegner</a> and <a
                        href="https://github.com/detouched">@detouched</a>, the Toolbox browser extension <strong>now
                    supports GitLab and Bitbucket</strong> in addition to GitHub. This means that from now on you can
                    easily clone your GitLab, Bitbucket, and GitHub repositories right from the browser with our
                    extensions for <a
                            href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jetbrains-toolbox-extensi/offnedcbhjldheanlbojaefbfbllddna">Chrome</a>
                    and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jetbrains-toolbox/">Firefox</a>. Happy
                    coding!</p>
                <p>As usual, many smaller fixes and improvements are included. See the <a
